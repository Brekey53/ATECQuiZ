## 📖 About

ATECQuiZ is a quiz application built as part of **UC00606**. It’s designed to help me (and others) practice software development in C#, emphasizing clean code structure, testability, and user interaction.

Key goals:

- Practice OOP in C#  
- Build a console-based / graphical quiz tool  
- Read/write files or persistent data (if applicable)  
- Improve user experience (menus, prompts, feedback)  

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Multiple-choice quiz questions  
- ✅ User-friendly console interface (or GUI, if you have one)  
- ✅ Scoring & feedback at end of quiz  
- ✅ Data persistence (saving progress / high scores) — *if implemented*  
- 🔧 Easily extendable: add new quiz topics or question sets
